Need to Fix:


10.10.19

The project cards on mobile are real narrow - will need to fix those before release.

The circular headshot on the home page is slightly oval – for some reason it’s making the height of the img 10px less than the width… very strange. And using the same styling as the About page headshot (although that one is perfectly circular).

On case study, the image container in the blurb is taller than the img and containers next to it.

On case study, the project background image is slightly wider than the section container and is forcing the page to be wider than it should be (i.e. deathly horizontal scrolling) (fyi seems to only be on larger screens)

*** FIXED! ***
“Design Projects” jump link isn’t jumping.

*** FIXED WITH HIDDEN INSET BORDER-BOTTOM ***
Nav - removed the forced “active” class on a nav <li> and that changes the height of the nav so we need to add some height or something

*** ALL OF THE BELOW ARE RESOLVED ***

Nav – losing links on mobile and no menu button at all?

Responsiveness on project columns? 

I feel like I’m not using the & css stuff right? So I’m trying to avoid using it and thus making a mess of the css.

And then big thing – What’s the best way to do TIL posts?
