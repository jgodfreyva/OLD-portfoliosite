Keeping Track of What I Did – 

Thu Aug 22, 2019
- Jeez almost 4 months since I last worked on this! Wedding planning and leaving my job took over. But I'm back!
- Updated stroke style for behind card img - it felt a little blah and now the strokes add depth and flair, if you will.
- Introduced a new year format for the project cards.

Thu Apr 25, 2019
- Happy April 25th :) Made some text changes and tried out a new image for a project-card but the white img on white background does not look good. Probably will swap that out.

- Woah, it's been a while. I got sidetracked with life and day job things for a few weeks there.
-Anyways, today I started messing with the styles for the design projects on the home page. It's starting to come together. Pretty stylin' if I may say so myself.
- Had forgotten how to make jump links so that was a good refresher. And I learned about the css scroll-behavior property – that was an exciting find!
- Added some follow-along details to the footer.

- Tried transferring my nav code into a partial and run that using sinatra. It turned into more of a struggle than I bargained for and it's not absolutely necessary at this moment so I switched gears. 
- Added styling to the mobile nav menu
- Added a media query to scale the H1 sizing down for mobile and few other small things to improve mobile experience

- Fixed some typos, removed a superfluous class
- Got stuck in a huge wormhole on styling my active nav link. I kept running into the problem where adding a border that shows on hover of a nav link would add a few pixels to the overall height and create a janky wobble effect. Border-box box-sizing wasn't doing the trick but inset borders have saved the day and I can officially say I like my nav links, hovers and all. 
- Touched up the TIL page headline decoration. Liking that mucho better.

- So I rebuilt the nav and it's sooo much better. Like night and day. I didn't have to do as much styling this time around either. I also converted the colors in my css over to variables (i.e. custom properties) for easier management in the future.

- Got some help from my friend slash old coworker, Paul. He helped me fix my nav's collapse problem (I didn't have the js hooked up - shoot!) and advised me to just rebuild the darn thing (wise advice), among a few other things. Thanks for the help, Paul!

- Happy New Year! Finally got some good work in --
- Created a couple of new pages
- Started building the TIL (Today I Learned) page and made my first post using a bootstrap well. Styling that was pretty fun. 

December 2018
- Did absolutely nuuuuthin' on this because I moved from the District to Del Ray, Alexandria, VA. And then the holidays happened. Excited to get back to it on this.

- Fixed the project columns and refined padding
- Changed the hero intro text
- Made some progress on the nav – it shows links now on desktop but haven't figured out how to get them to show in the mobile dropdown menu. 

Sun Nov 18, 2018
- Fixed the nav line-height
- Made a readme and learned about readme markdown
- Nailed the colors down and made a fun visual reference for the readme
- Ooh and I made a custom terminal profile and it’s dope!
– Also customized my .bash_profile to highlight the prompt. It’s much easier to read now.
