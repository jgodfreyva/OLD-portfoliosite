- So I rebuilt the nav and it's sooo much better. Like night and day. I didn't have to do as much styling this time around either. I also converted the colors in my css over to variables (i.e. custom properties) for easier management in the future.

- Got some help from my friend slash old coworker, Paul. He helped me fix my nav's collapse problem (I didn't have the js hooked up - shoot!) and advised me to just rebuild the darn thing (wise advice), among a few other things. Thanks for the help, Paul!

- Happy New Year! Finally got some good work in --
- Created a couple of new pages
- Started building the TIL (Today I Learned) page and made my first post using a bootstrap well. Styling that was pretty fun.

- Did absolutely nuuuuthin' on this because I moved from the District to Del Ray, Alexandria, VA. And then the holidays happened. Excited to get back to it on this.

- Fixed the project columns and refined padding
- Changed the hero intro text
- Made some progress on the nav – it shows links now on desktop but haven't figured out how to get them to show in the mobile dropdown menu.

- Fixed the nav line-height
- Made a readme and learned about readme markdown
- Nailed the colors down and made a fun visual reference for the readme
- Ooh and I made a custom terminal profile and it’s dope!
– Also customized my .bash_profile to highlight the prompt. It’s much easier to read now.
