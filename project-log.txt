Keeping Track of What I Did – 

Sun Nov 18, 2018
- Fixed the nav line-height
- Made a readme and learned about readme markdown
- Nailed the colors down and made a fun visual reference for the readme
- Ooh and I made a custom terminal profile and it’s dope!
– Also customized my .bash_profile to highlight the prompt. It’s much easier to read now.
