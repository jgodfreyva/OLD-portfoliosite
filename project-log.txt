Keeping Track of What I Did – 

Sun Jan 20, 2019
- Tried transferring my nav code into a partial and run that using sinatra. It turned into more of a struggle than I bargained for and it's not absolutely necessary at this moment so I switched gears.

- Fixed some typos, removed a superfluous class
- Got stuck in a huge wormhole on styling my active nav link. I kept running into the problem where adding a border that shows on hover of a nav link would add a few pixels to the overall height and create a janky wobble effect. Border-box box-sizing wasn't doing the trick but inset borders have saved the day and I can officially say I like my nav links, hovers and all. 
- Touched up the TIL page headline decoration. Liking that mucho better.

- So I rebuilt the nav and it's sooo much better. Like night and day. I didn't have to do as much styling this time around either. I also converted the colors in my css over to variables (i.e. custom properties) for easier management in the future.

- Got some help from my friend slash old coworker, Paul. He helped me fix my nav's collapse problem (I didn't have the js hooked up - shoot!) and advised me to just rebuild the darn thing (wise advice), among a few other things. Thanks for the help, Paul!

- Happy New Year! Finally got some good work in --
- Created a couple of new pages
- Started building the TIL (Today I Learned) page and made my first post using a bootstrap well. Styling that was pretty fun.

- Did absolutely nuuuuthin' on this because I moved from the District to Del Ray, Alexandria, VA. And then the holidays happened. Excited to get back to it on this.

- Fixed the project columns and refined padding
- Changed the hero intro text
- Made some progress on the nav – it shows links now on desktop but haven't figured out how to get them to show in the mobile dropdown menu.

- Fixed the nav line-height
- Made a readme and learned about readme markdown
- Nailed the colors down and made a fun visual reference for the readme
- Ooh and I made a custom terminal profile and it’s dope!
– Also customized my .bash_profile to highlight the prompt. It’s much easier to read now.
