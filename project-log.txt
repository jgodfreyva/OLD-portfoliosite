Keeping Track of What I Did – 

Wed Jan 2, 2019
- Happy New Year! Finally got some good work in --
- Created a couple of new pages
- Started building the TIL (Today I Learned) page and made my first post using a bootstrap well. Styling that was pretty fun.

- Fixed the project columns and refined padding
- Changed the hero intro text
- Made some progress on the nav – it shows links now on desktop but haven't figured out how to get them to show in the mobile dropdown menu.

- Fixed the nav line-height
- Made a readme and learned about readme markdown
- Nailed the colors down and made a fun visual reference for the readme
- Ooh and I made a custom terminal profile and it’s dope!
– Also customized my .bash_profile to highlight the prompt. It’s much easier to read now.
